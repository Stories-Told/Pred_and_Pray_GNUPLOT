# Pred_and_Pray_GNUPLOT

SIMULATION OF A ELK MASTER MOVING TOWARDS A SET DESTINATION ON A X AND Y GRAPH (USER ALLOWED TO INCREASE GRID SIZE AT RUN TIME). 
THE ELK MASTER AND ELK HERD ARE CREATED (USER ALLOWED TO INCREASE HERD SIZE AT RUNTIME) 
AND THEN PLACED INSIDE A LINKED LIST. A SET OF WOLVES (USER ALLOWED TO INCREASE WOLF SIZE AT RUNETIME)
IS ALSO CREATED AND PLACED INTO A LINKED LIST. AS THE ELK MASTER MOVES, THE HERD FOLLOWS HIM. THE WOLVES WILL
ALSO BE LOOKING FOR CERTAIN PARAMETERS TO MEET IN ORDER TO ATTACK ELK IN THE HERD. IF THE PARAMETERS
MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS THE ELK WILL BE DELETED FROM THE LINKED LIST. ALL GRAPHICS ARE DONE USING
GNUPLOT.

KEY TAKEAWAYS: CREATING LINKED LIST BY HAND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THEM, DELETION OF NODES
IN A LINKED LIST, RELINKING AFTER DELETING A NODE, USING CLASSES, AND CREATING OBJECTS.
